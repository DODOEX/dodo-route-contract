# FeeRoute

Main Contract: ./contracts/SmartRoute/DODORouteProxy.sol

DODORouteProxy is a new routeProxy contract with fee rebate to manage all route. It provides three methods to swap, including mixSwap,multiSwap and externalSwap. Mixswap is for linear swap, which describes one token path with one pool each time. Multiswap is a simplified version about 1inch, which describes one token path with several pools each time. ExternalSwap is for other routers like 0x, 1inch and paraswap. Dodo and front-end users could take certain route fee rebate from each swap. Wherein dodo will get a fixed percentage, and front-end users could assign any proportion through function parameters. 


Inheritaged a template using Foundry && HardHat architecture.
We use hardhat test.

## Motivation

With this new architecture, we can get:

- Unit tests written in solidity
- Foundry's cast
- Integration testing with Hardhat
- Hardhat deploy & verify
- Typescript

### Foundry

**Foundry is a blazing fast, portable and modular toolkit for Ethereum
application development written in Rust.**

Foundry consists of:

- [**Forge**](./forge): Ethereum testing framework (like Truffle, Hardhat and
  Dapptools).
- [**Cast**](./cast): Swiss army knife for interacting with EVM smart contracts,
  sending transactions and getting chain data.

Book][foundry-book] (WIP)!**

### Hardhat

Hardhat is an Ethereum development environment for professionals. It facilitates performing frequent tasks, such as running tests, automatically checking code for mistakes or interacting with a smart contract.

On [Hardhat's website](https://hardhat.org) you will find:

- [Guides to get started](https://hardhat.org/getting-started/)
- [Hardhat Network](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-network/)
- [Plugin list](https://hardhat.org/plugins/)

## Installation

### Foundry

First run the command below to get `foundryup`, the Foundry toolchain installer:

```sh
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

If you do not want to use the redirect, feel free to manually download the
foundryup installation script from
[here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gakonst/foundry/master/foundryup/install).

Then, in a new terminal session or after reloading your `PATH`, run it to get
the latest `forge` and `cast` binaries:

```sh
foundryup
```

Advanced ways to use `foundryup`, and other documentation, can be found in the
[foundryup package](./foundryup/README.md). Happy forging!

### Hardhat

`npm install` or `yarn`

## Commands

```sh
Scripts available via `npm run-script`:
  compile
    npx hardhat compile
  coverage
    npx hardhat coverage --solcoverjs .solcover.js
  deploy
    npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
  integration
    npx hardhat test
  verify
    npx hardhat verify
```
```sh
Hardhat Commands
  integration tests
    yarn integration
  coverage
    yarn coverage
```
```sh
Foundry Commands
  unit tests
    forge test
  coverage
    forge coverage
```
## Adding dependency

Prefer `npm` packages when available and update the remappings.

### Example

install:
`yarn add -D @openzeppelin/contracts`

remapping:
`@openzeppelin/contracts=node_modules/@openzeppelin/contracts`

import:
`import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";`
